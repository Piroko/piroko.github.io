### **Intro**
Hi, I'm Piroko.
I've retired from fansubbing, manga typesetting, and VN editing, but I still do one-shots and side-projects from time to time.
I'm an audiophile, PC gamer, anison DJ, and rhythm game enthusiast. Usually listens to anime soundtracks/albums/remixes/J-Core, future bass, glitchhop, and Vocaloid, while DJing at gatherings and anime conventions occasionally.
